# Code Quiz
---
![]

## Description

This project is a timed coding quiz with multpile choice questions which are updated dynamically using JavaScript. I was motivated to create an interactive, colourful page with a clean and responsive user interface. This has taugt me how to use DOM elements, eventListeners, functions and how to dynamically update HTML and CSS using JavaScript

## Technologies used 

HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Usage

Start the quiz by pressing the begin button, which will start the timer and load the mutliple choice question one at a time. If the user gets a question wrong, 10 seconds is deducted from their timer. Once the quiz is complete, the user will get their score and be asked to enter their initials, which will then take them to the highscores page to see where their ranked.

- An alert appears should the user attempt to submit an empty form
